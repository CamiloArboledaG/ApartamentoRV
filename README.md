# ApartamentosRV

Guided project for the sector of sale of houses and apartments for people of stratum 6, this experience has a virtual reality view in which the viewer can explore one of the apartments that is on offer, the project is mounted with a-frame and the models are made in sketchup, the model has a furnished and close to the very favorable reality

## Commencing üöÄ

_In order to view the project it is recommended to have a local repository and make the following line of code_

git clone https://github.com/jairov92/ApartamentosRV.git


### Prerequisites üìã

_Before using the app make sure that in your browser you can run an extension called live server or if you have one similar, in addition to this that the browser has the sound function enabled since the project has ambient music_

```
Open with live server and explore virtual reality with A-frame
```

### Creation process  üîß

We start with the development of modeling, the first thing we have to take into account is the reference image that was assigned for the creation of this

With this in mind we started with the creation of the apartment giving us a pretty good model and it looked good to start

```
Apartment modeling was done in sketchUp
```

It starts with the development of the apartment and assigns some dimensions that you see in the image, after this we paste textures and see in a-frame that looks

To give it more realism was placed a skymap of the https://hdrihaven.com/ around the apartment which is next

```

```

After this we do 2 steps that are to place collisions

Place 3d objects downloaded for free from the internet on the https://sketchfab.com/feed where we find models in obj and gtlf

we noticed that the colors had certain flaws so it was decided to change the color of the floor and walls to give it a darker tone and that the textures loaded better

To finish the report, the respective collisions of all the objects in the apartment were made as follows

```
Collisions like those on the walls were made with plans and some others with boxes
```




## additional information  ü§ì
In addition, a new folder called AR was created within the project, which in it contains the same information and object files as that of the original experience, but with the exception that the index is programmed to show us the apartment from the ceiling with the perspective of Augmented Reality as seen incontinuation

```
Ar.js and A-frame were used for this RA project
```
